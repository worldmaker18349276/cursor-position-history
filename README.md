# cursor-position-history package

Fork of [last-cursor-position](https://github.com/last-cursor-position/last-cursor-position).

Cursor Position History is a package for Atom that keeps a history of past cursor positions and allows to travel Between them.
The cursor position is recorded only when stop moving.
Each tab has its own history of cursor positions.

* `alt--` to travel to previous cursor position
* `alt-_` to undo previous travel
* `alt-R` will clear all previous cursor positions in the current tab
